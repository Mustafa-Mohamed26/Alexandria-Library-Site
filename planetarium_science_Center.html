                      The Planetarium Science Center (PSC) is an ideal place to enjoy a day of fun learning. It is an independent non-profit educational foundation dedicated to increasing the public's awareness, interest, and understanding of science and technology through entertainment.
                      The PSC launched the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) in Egypt in 2006, the Science Festivity in 2008, and the Intel Bibliotheca Alexandrina Science and Engineering Fair (Intel BASEF) in 2010. The PSC hosted the Secretariat Office of the North Africa and Middle East Network of Science Centers (NAMES) in 2006. In 2008, the PSC launched the Electronic Resource Centerâ€™s website and produced the new planetarium show Sky of Alexandria, which was the first of its kind to be produced entirely in Africa and the Middle East. In 2010, in collaboration with the PSC, CULTNAT produced Astronomical Myths, the first Egyptian full-dome movie for planetarium display. In 2009, the PSC won two silver medals at the International Environmental Project Olympiad (INEPO) held in Istanbul, Turkey. In the same year, the PSC won numerous awards at the Intel Science Competition in the Arab World (ISC Arab): third prize in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and second and fourth prize in Environmental Management. The BA received the Judges Award for Best Robot Design and Best Solution at the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) World Festival held in 2008 and 2009 in the USA. PSC participants won numerous prizes at the Arab Intel 2010 Competition.

                      The Center fulfills its goals by encouraging curiosity, imagination, and creativity through a large number of diverse activities presented by three sections, each of which approaches science in a different manner that is relatively unconventional to the Egyptian community:

                          <h3>The Planetarium: </h3>
                          <p>
                              a member of the International Planetarium Society (IPS) and a cutting-edge facility featuring state-of-the-art projection technology. The Planetarium aims to help establish a scientific culture in Egypt by offering the public a kaleidoscope of fascinating scientific shows that cover a diverse variety of scientific fields and are suitable for a wide range of groups.
                              Re-opened in August 2009, the Planetarium offers, in addition to the classic IMAX projection system, full-dome digital shows that use the latest Digistar 3 system. This system details the universe impeccably, bringing it so close to the public they feel as if they are flying through space and time. The Planetarium also offers live shows presented by resident astronomers.

                          <h3>The History of Science Museum: </h3>
                          <p>
                              a permanent exhibition that highlights the historical aspect of science in Egypt during three major periods: ancient Egypt, Hellenistic Alexandria, and the Arab-Muslim World. The Museum pays homage to scientists who have enriched scientific knowledge. The Museum aims to revive the scientific discoveries and great achievements of the ancient scholars and their translators, without whom such writings would not have transcended space and time.

                          <p>
                              The History of Science Museum is not a traditional museum; it offers a variety of activities targeting school children in particular and the public in general. It also offers traditional tours.

                          <h3>The ALEXploratorium: </h3>
                          <p>
                              a fascinating and innovative establishment. It is a hands-on science facility that is unconventional both in concept and operation. It primarily targets children and youth, who are the future and hope of Egypt. It aims to intrigue them through interactive exhibitions, workshops, and other programs and activities. These activities are held under the guidance and supervision of dedicated staff members, whose objective is to relay scientific principles in a simple, fun manner.
                          </p>
                          <br>
                          <p>
                              ALEXploratorium activities are not limited to the young. They attract visitors of all ages and backgrounds to science by making it more accessible, more understandable, and far more interesting. Most importantly, they show visitors how they can experience science in almost everything they see, hear, or touch in their everyday lives.
